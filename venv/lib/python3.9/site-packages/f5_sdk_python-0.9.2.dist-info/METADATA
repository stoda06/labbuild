# Introduction

The F5 SDK (Python) provides client libraries to access various F5 products and services. It focuses primarily on facilitating consuming our most popular APIs and services, currently including BIG-IP (via Automation Tool Chain) and F5 Cloud Services.

Benefits:

- Provides hand-written or auto-generated client code to make F5â€™s APIs/services simple and intuitive to use.
- Handles the low-level details of communication with the API or service, including authentication sessions, async task handling, protocol handling, large file uploads, and more.
- Can be installed using familiar package management tools such as pip.
